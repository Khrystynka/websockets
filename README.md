# websockets
 Tic-tac-toe game for multiple players 
 I wanted to learn how to create an application that is stateful and manages multiple network connections, and how to work with threads and event loops. Server-side is written in Python using websockets and asyncio event loops. I was curious how to make a server-side application that doesn’t need thread per client but still, all of the game logic and client interactions are handled asynchronously. The server is responsible for finding an opponent for a user (so that there is never more than one user without an opponent), creating a new game, receiving the client’s moves, updating the game’s state, and sending the game state to the corresponding players. The client-side is also written in Python and has two main parts, the game loop and network client, each in its own thread. The game loop is in the main thread using pygame library while the network client is using asyncio event loop and websockets to communicate with the server. Communication and synchronization between two parts are based on the event queue.
